# ChoccySwap
ChoccySwap is the first dex on the <a href="https://chromia.com">Chromia</a> blockchain 
We have implemented a **feeless** Uniswap v2 clone, and the DAO will help us decide what to add next!

## Why uni v2?
Uniswap v3, with its concentrated liquidity, lets you put money in a small price range. This gives you greater profits in that range, and no profits outside of that. Since Chromia isn't widely used, there wouldn't be much liquidity in any pair. This means that the price will vary widely, and most people wouldn't be able to profit if they didn't think about this fact. To protect users, in the first period of this project's life, we're gonna go with a more intuitive, easier to understand, uniswap v2-like codebase. We are, however, going to implement the v3 mechanics later on.

## What will the DAO be used for?
We have so many ideas for this project, we need you to choose what's important and what is not! The two ideas we're already working on are:
<ul>
  <li>NFT exchange (sell, buy, auction, create...): while Chromia Originals will probably be listed on other NFT websites, having it on the Chromia chain will let you exchange game items seamlessly, without even having to log in and sign transactions, between different games on the Chromia ecosystem</li>
  <li>Loans: what if you could take the money you earn in a game, use it to get a loan to make progress in another game, and then pay the loan back after having earned that money back thanks to your upgrades?</li>
</ul>

It will also be used to pay the necessary expenses (hosting fees, developer wage, advertisement) since we have *literally no fees* to use our website. We decided not to set up fixed transaction fees, but we'll let the DAO decide whether we should add them or not.
